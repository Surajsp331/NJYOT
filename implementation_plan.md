# Implementation Plan - Voylla Style Overhaul

This plan outlines the steps to upgrade NJYOT to a premium jewelry e-commerce site inspired by Voylla.

## Phase 1: Visual Structure & Navigation (The "Look")
- [ ] **Top Bar**: Add a dark/gold top bar for announcements ("Free Shipping...").
- [ ] **Header Upgrade**: Implement hover dropdowns for "Shop" to show categories (Necklaces, Earrings, etc.) directly.
- [ ] **Hero Slider**: Convert the static Hero section into a simple JavaScript-based image slider with 2-3 premium banners.

## Phase 2: Homepage Experience
- [ ] **Category Tiles**: Refine category grids to use circular high-quality images or distinct tiles like Voylla.
- [ ] **Featured Sections**: Add "Best Sellers" and "New Arrivals" with a carousel or clean grid layout.
- [ ] **Trust Badges**: Add a "Why Buy From Us" section with icons (Lifetime Plating, Easy Returns, etc.).

## Phase 3: Product Detail Enhancements
- [ ] **Image Gallery**: Add support for clicking thumbnails to change the main image.
- [ ] **Delivery Check**: Add a UI component for "Enter Pincode for Delivery Date".
- [ ] **Wishlist**: Add a "Heart" icon that toggles state (saved to LocalStorage).

## Phase 4: Polish & Error Checking
- [ ] **Cart Polish**: Ensure the floating cart and cart page look consistent.
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify all new elements stack correctly on mobile.
- [ ] **Code Cleanup**: Remove any unused CSS or console logs.
